# Frequently asked Hoodies
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hoodiehq/faq.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/hoodiehq/faq)

This repository's issue tracker will be used to collect, discuss and finally answer frequently asked questions.
All question that are labeled "answered" will then be extracted with the GitHub API to display them nicely on a website and make them searchable.

The issues's title will be interpreted as the actual question, while the body of the opening post will be treated as the answer.
Resources can be collected and discussion can take place in the comments.
